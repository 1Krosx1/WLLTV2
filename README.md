## Mission and Vision

### Our Mission

To preserve and promote the Minasbate language by providing an accessible, engaging, and highly personalized learning tool. We empower individuals to learn at their own pace and become active participants in their language journey by enabling them to build their own custom dictionaries. By prioritizing offline, on-device data storage, we ensure that every user has complete ownership and privacy over their learning progress and personal contributions to the language.

### Our Vision

To create a vibrant, thriving digital community where the Minasbate language is not only learned but lived. We envision a future where every generation, near or far, can connect with their cultural heritage, share their knowledge, and ensure that the richness of Minasbate is carried forward. Our app will serve as a catalyst for cultural pride and a living, user-built archive that helps the language flourish in the modern world.

## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. This policy outlines how we handle your information. The core principle of this app is that **your data is your own**.

All user data, including your profile (nickname and photo), custom words, audio recordings, and activity progress, is stored **only on your own device**. This information is never uploaded to any server, and it is never seen by us or any third party. Because your data is stored locally, you have complete control over it.

We collect this information solely to provide and improve the app's featuresâ€”personalizing greetings, building your personal dictionary, and tracking your learning progress. The app requests microphone access only when you choose to record audio for a new word. You can modify, edit, delete, export, or completely erase all of your data at any time using the features within the app.
